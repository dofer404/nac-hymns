        - A computer with [Flutter](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install) installed 
    - Clone [this project](https://github.com/dofer404/nac_hymns) on your computer
    - Connect your Android phone to your computer for development.
        - Accept the USB Debug related dialog that the phone shows.
    - Get a terminal into the cloned repository, cd into the ar_nac_hymns directory
    - Execute the command "flutter run"
        - The app will be installed and opened on your phone
